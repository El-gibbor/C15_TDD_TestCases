# Task 2 - say_my_name
- **Document your module, classes and functions:**  
    - All your modules (files), classes, and functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation. check [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/dOO785g5EQYkRU2E1wri0g) to learn how to document your module and functions/methods.  
    - Your documentation must be a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module(file), class or method because the length of it will be verified.
    - Validate the length of your module documentation with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("your_module").__doc__)' | wc -l`. Replace `your_module` with the name of your file without the `.py` extension, and this should print at least **5**.
    - Do the same for your function documentation with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("your_function").add_integer.__doc__)' | wc -l` Replace `your_function` with the name of your function, and this should print at least **3**.
## Testing with your Python Shell üêç
Leveraging the Python shell can be incredibly beneficial. Here are some tips to make the most of it:  
- **Explore Various Inputs:** Use the Python shell to experiment with different inputs. Test your code with a variety of values and scenarios to ensure it behaves as intended.  
- **Verify Expected Output:** Check if your code produces the expected output for the given inputs. If the computed result matches your expectations, consider it a successful test case.
- **Handle Exceptions:** Pay attention to any traceback calls and exceptions raised during testing. Your test cases should handle these exceptions appropriately. If the task specifies a particular exception type and error message, ensure your code matches these requirements.    
## Test Cases 
- Verify that the function correctly handles valid inputs where both `first_name` and `last_name` are strings, constructing a complete sentence.  
- **Missing last name** - Verify that the function correctly handles the case where only the first name is provided
- Test for an invalid input where the last name is not a string and confirm your function raises the appropriate  Exception and error message.
- Test for an invalid input where the first name is not a string and confirm your function raises the appropriate  Exception and error message.
- Ensure that regular cases where both first_name and last_name are provided and are strings pass successfully  
- **Missing Two Arguments** - Check that the function raises the appropraite Exception and message when both `first_name` and `last_name` are missing
- Test for successful pass with just one argument.
