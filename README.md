# TDD Project - Test & EdgeCases üîç
In response to strong encouragement to work together on test cases to ensure we cover all edge cases, I've created this repository. It's designed to be a collaborative space where we can curate an extensive collection of test cases. Our goal is to assist individuals, especially those in our current cohort and future cohorts, in enhancing their Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills by offering a diverse set of test cases, including edge cases.  
  
This repository is not/shouldn't be limited to our current TDD project but also serves as an evolving resource for future projects that require rigorous test case development. Together, we can continuously update and expand it to meet the demands of various future projects like the Airbnb clone and other development endeavours where comprehensive tests are expected.

## Guidelines for Contributions üëåüèæ
To maintain the quality and usefulness of this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:
  
- Ensure that your test cases are well-documented and easy to understand.  
- Include comments explaining the purpose and expected outcomes of each test.  
- Keep your code clean and adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guidelines.  
- Be respectful and considerate of other contributors' work.
  
**NB:**  If you are not yet good with markdown/readme formatting, then you can create a test file (eg: `task-0_test.txt`) inside the task directory and type in all the possible test and edge cases you have.  
  
Active participation and collaboration within us is highly encouraged. Feel free to open issues, ask questions, or provide feedback on existing contributions. Together, we can build a valuable resource for ourselves, our succeeding cohorts and anyone learning and practising TDD.
